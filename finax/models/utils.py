    """Prepares grid of times for path generation.

    Args:
        times:  Rank 1 `Tensor` of increasing positive real values. The times at
        which the path points are to be evaluated.
        time_step: Rank 0 real `Tensor`. Maximal distance between points in
        resulting grid.
        dtype: `tf.Dtype` of the input and output `Tensor`s.
        tolerance: A non-negative scalar `Tensor` specifying the minimum tolerance
        for discernible times on the time grid. Times that are closer than the
        tolerance are perceived to be the same.
        Default value: `None` which maps to `1-e6` if the for single precision
            `dtype` and `1e-10` for double precision `dtype`.
        num_time_steps: Number of points on the grid. If suppied, a uniform grid
        is constructed for `[time_step, times[-1] - time_step]` consisting of
        max(0, num_time_steps - len(times)) points that is then concatenated with
        times. This parameter guarantees the number of points on the time grid
        is `max(len(times), num_time_steps)` and that `times` are included to the
        grid.
        Default value: `None`, which means that a uniform grid is created.
        containing all points from 'times` and the uniform grid of points between
        `[0, times[-1]]` with grid size equal to `time_step`.
        times_grid: An optional rank 1 `Tensor` representing time discretization
        grid. If `times` are not on the grid, then the nearest points from the
        grid are used.
        Default value: `None`, which means that times grid is computed using
        `time_step` and `num_time_steps`.

    Returns:
        Tuple `(all_times, mask, time_indices)`.
        `all_times` is a 1-D real `Tensor`. If `num_time_steps` is supplied the
        shape of the output is `max(num_time_steps, len(times))`. Otherwise
        consists of all points from 'times` and the uniform grid of points between
        `[0, times[-1]]` with grid size equal to `time_step`.
        `mask` is a boolean 1-D `Tensor` of the same shape as 'all_times', showing
        which elements of 'all_times' correspond to THE values from `times`.
        Guarantees that times[0]=0 and mask[0]=False.
        `time_indices`. An integer `Tensor` of the same shape as `times` indicating
        `times` indices in `all_times`.
