    For a more complete description of the terminology as well as the mathematics
    of pricing bonds, see Ref [1]. In particular, note that `yields` here refers
    to the yield of the bond as defined in Section 4.4 of Ref [1]. This is
    sometimes also referred to as the internal rate of return of a bond.

    #### Example

    The following example demonstrates the present value computation for two
    bonds. Both bonds have 1000 face value with semi-annual coupons. The first
    bond has 4% coupon rate and 2 year expiry. The second has 6% coupon rate and
    3 year expiry. The yields to maturity (ytm) are 7% and 5% respectively.

    ```python
    dtype = jnp.float64

    # The first element is the ytm of the first bond and the second is the
    # yield of the second bond.
    yields_to_maturity = jnp.asarray([0.07, 0.05], dtype=dtype)

    # 2 and 3 year bonds with 1000 face value and 4%, 6% semi-annual coupons.
    # Note that the first four entries in the cashflows are the cashflows of
    # the first bond (group=0) and the next six are the cashflows of the second
    # bond (group=1).
    cashflows = jnp.asarray([20, 20, 20, 1020, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, 1030],

    # Group entries take values between 0 and 1 (inclusive) as there are two
    # bonds. One needs to assign each of the cashflow entries to one group or
    # the other.
    groups = jnp.asarray([0] * 4 + [1] * 6)

    # Produces [942.712, 1025.778] as the values of the two bonds.

    Args:
    cashflows: Real rank 1 `ndarray` of size `n`. The set of cashflows underlying
        the bonds.
    times: Real positive rank 1 `ndarray` of size `n`. The set of times at which
        the corresponding cashflows occur quoted in years.
    yields: Real rank 1 `ndarray` of size `1` if `groups` is None or of size `k`
        if the maximum value in the `groups` is of `k-1`. The continuously
        compounded yields to maturity/internal rate of returns corresponding to
        each of the cashflow groups. The `i`th component is the yield to apply to
        all the cashflows with group label `i` if `groups` is not None. If
        `groups` is None, then this is a `ndarray` of size `[1]` and the only
        component is the yield that applies to all the cashflows.
    groups: Optional int `ndarray` of size `n` containing values between 0 and
        `k-1` where `k` is the number of related cashflows.
        Default value: None. This implies that all the cashflows are treated as a
        single group.
    dtype: `jnp.dtype`. If supplied the dtype for the input and output `ndarray`s.
        Default value: None which maps to the default dtype inferred from
        `cashflows`.

    Returns:
    Real rank 1 `ndarray` of size `k` if groups is not `None` else of size `[1]`.
        The present value of the cashflows. The `i`th component is the present
        value of the cashflows in group `i` or to the entirety of the cashflows
        if `groups` is None.
