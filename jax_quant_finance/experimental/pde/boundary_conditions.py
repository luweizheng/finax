  """Wrapper for Dirichlet boundary conditions to be used in PDE solvers.

  Example: the boundary value is 1 on both boundaries.

  ```python
  def lower_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
    return 1

  def upper_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
    return 0

  solver = fd_solvers.solve_forward(...,

                              dirichlet(upper_boundary_fn))],
      ...)
  ```

  Also can be used as a decorator:

  ```python
  @dirichlet
  def lower_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
    return 1

  @dirichlet
  def upper_boundary_fn(t, location_grid):
    return 0

  solver = fd_solvers.solve_forward(...,
      boundary_conditions = [(lower_boundary_fn, upper_boundary_fn)],
      ...)
  ```

  Args:
    boundary_values_fn: Callable returning the boundary values at given time.
      Accepts two arguments - the moment of time and the current coordinate
      grid.
      Returns a number, a zero-rank Tensor or a Tensor of shape
      `batch_shape + grid_shape'`, where `grid_shape'` is grid_shape excluding
      the axis orthogonal to the boundary. For example, in 3D the value grid
      shape is `batch_shape + (z_size, y_size, x_size)`, and the boundary
      tensors on the planes `y = y_min` and `y = y_max` should be either scalars
      or have shape `batch_shape + (z_size, x_size)`. In 1D case this reduces
      to just `batch_shape`.

  Returns:
    Callable suitable for PDE solvers.
