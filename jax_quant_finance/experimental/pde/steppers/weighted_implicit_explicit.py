def weighted_implicit_explicit_step(theta):
    """Creates a stepper function with weighted implicit-explicit scheme.

    Given a space-discretized equation

    ```
    du/dt = A(t) u(t) + b(t)
    ```
    (here `u` is a value vector, `A` and `b` are the matrix and the vector defined
    by the PDE), the scheme approximates the right-hand side as a weighted average
    of values taken before and after a time step:

    ```
    (u(t2) - u(t1)) / (t2 - t1) = theta * (A(t1) u(t1) + b(t1))
        + (1 - theta) (A(t2) u(t2) + b(t2)).
    ```

    Includes as particular cases the implicit (`theta = 0`), explicit
    (`theta = 1`), and Crank-Nicolson (`theta = 0.5`) schemes.

    The scheme is stable for `theta >= 0.5`, is second order accurate if
    `theta = 0.5` (i.e. in Crank-Nicolson case), and first order accurate
    otherwise.

    More details can be found in `weighted_implicit_explicit_scheme` below.

    Args:
        theta: A float in range `[0, 1]`. A parameter used to mix implicit and
        explicit schemes together. Value of `0.0` corresponds to the fully
        implicit scheme, `1.0` to the fully explicit, and `0.5` to the
        Crank-Nicolson scheme.

    Returns:
        Callable to be used in finite-difference PDE solvers (see fd_solvers.py).

def weighted_implicit_explicit_scheme(theta):
    """Constructs weighted implicit-explicit scheme.

    Approximates the space-discretized equation of `du/dt = A(t) u(t) + b(t)` as
    ```
    (u(t2) - u(t1)) / (t2 - t1) = theta * (A u(t1) + b)
        + (1 - theta) (A u(t2) + b),
    ```
    where `A = A((t1 + t2)/2)`, `b = b((t1 + t2)/2)`, and `theta` is a float
    between `0` and `1`.

    Note that typically `A` and `b` are evaluated at `t1` and `t2` in
    the explicit and implicit terms respectively (the two terms of the right-hand
    side). Instead, we evaluate them at the midpoint `(t1 + t2)/2`, which saves
    some computation. One can check that evaluating at midpoint doesn't change the
    order of accuracy of the scheme: it is still second order accurate in
    `t2 - t1` if `theta = 0.5` and first order accurate otherwise.

    The solution is the following:
    `u(t2) = (1 - (1 - theta) dt A)^(-1) * (1 + theta dt A) u(t1) + dt b`.

    The main bottleneck here is inverting the matrix `(1 - (1 - theta) dt A)`.
    This matrix is tridiagonal (each point is influenced by the two neighbouring
    points), and thus the inversion can be efficiently performed using
    `tf.linalg.tridiagonal_solve`.
