        Represents a general Ito process:

        ```None
        dX_i = a_i(t, X) dt + Sum(S_{ij}(t, X) dW_j for 1 <= j <= n), 1 <= i <= n

        The vector coefficient `a_i` is referred to as the drift of the process and
        the matrix `b_{ij}` as the volatility of the process. For the process to be
        well defined, these coefficients need to satisfy certain technical
        conditions which may be found in Ref. [1]. The vector `dW_j` represents
        independent Brownian increments.

        ```none
        dX_1 = mu_1 * sqrt(t) dt + s11 * dW_1 + s12 * dW_2
        dX_2 = mu_2 * sqrt(t) dt + s21 * dW_1 + s22 * dW_2
        ```

        Args:
        dim: Python int greater than or equal to 1. The dimension of the Ito
            process.
        drift_fn: A Python callable to compute the drift of the process. The
            callable should accept two real `ndarray` arguments of the same dtype.
            The first argument is the scalar time t, the second argument is the
            value of Ito process X - `ndarray` of shape
            `batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim]`, where `batch_shape` represents
            a batch of models and `sample_shape` represents samples for each of the
            models. The result is value of drift a(t, X). The return value of the
            callable is a real `ndarray` of the same dtype as the input arguments and
            of shape `batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim]`. For example,
            `sample_shape` can stand for `[num_samples]` for Monte Carlo sampling,
            or `[num_grid_points_1, ..., num_grid_points_dim]` for Finite Difference
            solvers.
        volatility_fn: A Python callable to compute the volatility of the process.
            The callable should accept two real `ndarray` arguments of the same dtype
            and shape `times_shape`. The first argument is the scalar time t, the
            second argument is the value of Ito process X - `ndarray` of shape
            `batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim]`, where `batch_shape` represents
            a batch of models and `sample_shape` represents samples for each of the
            models. The result is value of volatility S_{ij}(t, X). The return value
            of the callable is a real `ndarray` of the same dtype as the input
            arguments and of shape `batch_shape + sample_shape + [dim, dim]`. For
            example, `sample_shape` can stand for `[num_samples]` for Monte Carlo
            sampling, or `[num_grid_points_1, ..., num_grid_points_dim]` for Finite
            Difference solvers.

        The default implementation uses the Euler scheme. However, for particular
        types of Ito processes more efficient schemes can be used.

        Args:
        times: Rank 1 `Tensor` of increasing positive real values. The times at
            which the path points are to be evaluated.
        num_samples: Positive scalar `int`. The number of paths to draw.
            Default value: 1.

            `batch_shape + [num_samples, dim]`. The initial state of the process.
            `batch_shape` represents the shape of the independent batches of the
            stochastic process as in the `drift_fn` and `volatility_fn` of the
            underlying class. Note that the `batch_shape` is inferred from
            the `initial_state` and hence when sampling is requested for a batch of
            stochastic processes, the shape of `initial_state` should be as least
            `batch_shape + [1, 1]`.
            Default value: None which maps to a zero initial state.
        random_type: Enum value of `RandomType`. The type of (quasi)-random number
            generator to use to generate the paths.
            Default value: None which maps to the standard pseudo-random numbers.
        seed: Seed for the random number generator. The seed is
            only relevant if `random_type` is one of
            `[STATELESS, STATELESS_ANTITHETIC]`.
            Default value: 0.
        loop_method: An enum to specify which loop method to use: 
            * `jax_quant_finance.utils.LoopType.WHILE` for `jax.lax.while_loop`
            `jax_quant_finance.utils.LoopType.SCAN` for `jax.lax.scan`
            Default value: `LoopType.WHILE`.
        parallel_mode: An enum to specify which parallelization mode to use: 
            * `jax_quant_finance.utils.ParallelType.SINGLE_DEIVCE` for single device evaluation.
            * `jax_quant_finance.utils.ParallelType.MULTI_DEIVCE` for single host multiple devices evaluation.
            Default value: `ParallelType.SINGLE_DEIVCE`.
        time_step: An optional scalar real - maximal distance between
            points in the time grid.
            Either this or `num_time_steps` should be supplied.
            Default value: `None`.
        num_time_steps: An optional Scalar integer - a total number of
            time steps performed by the algorithm. The maximal distance between
            points in grid is bounded by
            `times[-1] / (num_time_steps - times.shape[0])`.
            Either this or `time_step` should be supplied.
            Default value: `None`.
        times_grid: An optional rank 1 `ndarray` representing time discretization
            grid. If `times` are not on the grid, then the nearest points from the
            grid are used.
            Default value: `None`, which means that times grid is computed using
            `time_step` and `num_time_steps`.
        validate_args: Python `bool`. When `True` performs multiple checks:
            * That `times`  are increasing with the minimum increments of the
                specified tolerance.
            When `False` invalid dimension may silently render incorrect outputs.
